                                          and ever since, I've developed many interactive features and web apps relying on it, it's right to say that JavaScript is the backbone of my web development skills.</p></li>
                <li><h3>HTML</h3><p>
                    I develop well-organized HTML structures for my projects to make them both easy to navigate and have a good optimization for search engines.

                <li><h3>CSS</h3><p> I Have a great experience in creating and designing a responsive and appealing layouts that work on multiple devices by using CSS.</p></li>

                <li><h3>React.JS</h3><p>Not much experience using React.js , but also not the worst in that field, I am able of creating simple apps using it, in fact React is what I'm learning in the mean time.</p></li>
                <li><h3>Unity game engine and C#</h3> <p>In terms of my skills, unity and C# must have an honorable mention, how not and they are what I've entered the world of programming with! now I can easily say that I have a great experience of approximately <strong>1 and a half years </strong> with them. </p></li>
